Techniques Used to Achieve Best Results
üîç Model and Tokenization
Pretrained Model: bert-base-uncased from Hugging Face Transformers.

Tokenization: Used Hugging Face AutoTokenizer, with truncation and padding.

Sequence Length: max_length = 512 tokens to preserve as much context as possible.

üßπ Data Preparation
Dataset: IMDb movie reviews via Hugging Face datasets library.

Sampled Dataset: Used 5000 samples for faster iteration.

Train/Validation Split: 90/10 split from the training data.

Label Format: Binary classification (Positive/Negative).

‚öôÔ∏è Training Configuration
Trainer API: Hugging Face Trainer with TrainingArguments.

Batch Size: 16 for training and evaluation.

Epochs: 3 full passes through the dataset.

Optimizer Settings:

learning_rate = 2e-5

weight_decay = 0.01

warmup_steps = 500 for gradual learning rate ramp-up.

Early Stopping: Implemented via EarlyStoppingCallback (patience = 3).

Evaluation Strategy: Evaluated and saved model every 500 steps.

Best Model Tracking: Based on highest validation F1-score.

üìâ Performance Debugging
Included a debug_model_performance() function:

Evaluates model quality on validation set.

Checks for overfitting by comparing training and validation accuracy.

Prints targeted suggestions for low (< 0.85) validation accuracy:

Tune learning rate, model architecture.

Augment data or adjust batch size.

Use dropout or regularization if overfitting is detected.

üé® Creative Application
Sentiment prediction on custom examples using .predict_sentiment().

Confidence scores included in output.

Display of real-world use cases.

üìà Visualization
Training Loss & Validation Loss curves.

Validation F1-score trends during training.

Confusion Matrix plot for test set.

üõ† Advanced Utilities (Optional)
Data Augmentation Stub: Synonym replacement placeholder.

Model Ensemble Support: Averaging predictions from multiple models.
